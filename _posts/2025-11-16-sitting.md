I attended my first meditation retreat this weekend. A central point the lama made was that in order to make progress on the path towards liberation, we need to be have clear motivation for being on the path on the first place, and then remember that motivation to help us stick to the practice even when it's hard and unpleasant.

What is my motivation? I don't remember what first got me interested in mindfulness and buddhism. I think it was during my time at Oxford, as I can't remember meditating when I lived in Bern or during my summer in Berlin. So, it would have been about 10 years ago. I also don't remember what motivated me to persist with it to the extent that I did (which is not very consistent, but I've kept it going for a decade now). Over time, though, it's become clear to me that mindfulness practice, even in moderate amounts, has enormous benefits for me. In fact, i firmly believe in Sam Harris' dictum that "the quality of your mind determines the quality of your life", and that mindfulness practice is the best way to improve the quality of the mind. Even the practice I have done over these years has made my life tremendously better.

But what precisely is my motivation to keep going? And how much do I want to practice?

The motivation is to free my mind from being dominated – run, really
