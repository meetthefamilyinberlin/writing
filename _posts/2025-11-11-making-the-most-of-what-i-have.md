title: Making the most of what I have
---
Is the belief that I have to make the most of what I have, that I have to reach my potential mine or inherited from my parents? I have never questioned it thus far. Of course I would. It's what will make me maximally successful. If I can use my head to make lots of money and work in a high-status job, of course I would do that instead of being a personal trainer or karate teacher. And, as part of that, of course I'd not waste a minute of my time (in the spirit of Arnold and Seneca).

But why do I think that is a good thing? Is it really me who thinks that? Or is is my parents? If I were dropped on a continent where nobody knew me and I have no contact to the outside world, I had to build my life from scratch and nobody I presently know would ever know what I did, what would I do?

Would I study economics and statistics? Definitely not. That reaction was so visceral it took me a split-second to answer. Would I teach? Perhaps. Would I be a personal trainer and health coach? Perhaps. A writer? Perhaps. What would I do?

I wanna keep thinking about this.
